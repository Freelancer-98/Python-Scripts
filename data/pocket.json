      "The moment I started, every day became an exercise in optimisation",
      "This is already pretty cool, but the most important outcome of introducing these points is that I stopped thinking about productivity in binary terms. Before the points, whenever I was too tired to do work, my thinking process would go like this: \"Since I'm not doing work (bad), I might as well scroll some social media (also bad)\", while after the points this became \"Alright, I am too tired to do work (not gaining 4 points) but maybe I can read a book (3 points) or go for a walk and listen to a podcast (3 points) instead\"",
      "Another important consideration is that 'hours spent on' is not a great measure of productivity - I want to achieve things and not just spend time doing busywork. To make sure that this is the case, I do weekly summaries, where I compare what I wanted to accomplish vs what I actually did accomplish in the past week and plan for the upcoming week.",
      "As I was analysing at my data throughout the year, I was quite disappointed in how little I worked and was looking for a way to increase it. Inspired by this post I decided to gamify my productivity by giving myself points for activities I wanted to do more of. I was hoping that they would act as sources of instantenous pleasure for my monkey brain (which wants fun now and doesn't really care about future me) to make it do things that might be less fun but beneficial in the long run.

      "The above query should do 10-20 GET requests, fetching a total of 130 - 270KiB, depending on if you ran the above demos as well. Note that it only has to do 20 requests and not 270 (as would be expected when fetching 270 KiB with 1 KiB at a time). That\u2019s because I implemented a pre-fetching system that tries to detect access patterns through three separate virtual read heads and exponentially increases the request size for sequential reads. This means that index scans or table scans reading more than a few KiB of data will only cause a number of requests that is logarithmic in the total byte length of the scan. ",
      "All of this only works well when we have indices in the database that match the queries well. For example, the index used in the above query is a INDEX ON wdi_data (indicator_code, country_code, year, value). If that index did not include the value column, the SQLite engine would have to do another random access (unpredictable) read and thus HTTP request to retrieve the actual value for every data point. If the index was ordered country_code, indicator_code, ..., then we would be able to quickly get all indicators for a single country, but not all country values of a single indicator.",
      "Since fetching data via HTTP has a pretty large overhead, we need to fetch data in chunks and find some balance between the number of requests and the used bandwidth. Thankfully, SQLite already organizes its database in \"pages\" with a user-defined page size (4 KiB by default). I\u2019ve set the page size to 1 KiB for this database.",
      "From SQLite\u2019s perspective, it just looks like it\u2019s living on a normal computer with an empty filesystem except for a file called /wdi.sqlite3 that it can read from. Of course it can\u2019t write to this file, but a read-only database is still very useful.",
      "sql.js only allows you to create and read from databases that are fully in memory though - so I implemented a virtual file system that fetches chunks of the database with HTTP Range requests when SQLite tries to read from the filesystem: sql.js-httpvfs.",
      "So how do you use a database on a static file hoster? Firstly, SQLite (written in C) is compiled to WebAssembly. SQLite can be compiled with emscripten without any modifications, and the sql.js library is a thin JS wrapper around the wasm code."

      "The fact that it is so opinionated on how you should be fetching your data, and the fact it focuses to intensely on the plugin ecosystem means that it is often hard to diverge from these",
      "Next.js is more versatile and flexible. If your project has the potential to grow beyond its current spec, I would go with Next",

      "The main argument for Next this time last year was the fact it was flexible. It didn't force the developer into an ecosystem of plugins and GraphQL. Making Next.js able to Pre-render pages at build time (SSG) or request time (SSR) in a single project and give the developer to choose one or the other and switch between the two is a huge gain for flexibility.",

    "tags": [
      "money"
    ],
    "annotations": [
      "Money is simply a commodity with the widest price discovery against all other commodities and because of that everyone accepts it. That is what gives money its purchasing power.",
      "Nobody decides how many grams of gold is a cow worth. The market gradually determines this exchange rate by accounting for supply and demand for both commodities: gold and cows.",
      "Little did the public know that by doing this they\u2019re setting themselves for the erosion of their purchasing power. Originally one dollar was one ounce (~31 grams) of silver. Today, that value has eroded over 96% and for one dollar you\u2019ll only get 0.04 ounces of silver.",
      "The key to understanding money is to remember that it is a commodity whose utility is in facilitating exchanges, just like leather is a commodity whose utility is in making shoe soles.",
      "Such coin debasement is a subtle way of stealing (or redistribution, depending on how you look at things). In other words, debasement leads to inflation. You have more coins in circulation for a similar amount of \u201cstuff\u201d in the world so the prices of \u201cstuff\u201d rise.",
      "Network effects mean that the more widely a currency is accepted by others, the more likely is it to get accepted by others. (This is also why bitcoin is the mother of all network effects).",
      "Here\u2019s the pitch of the govt to its citizens: a central bank will be established that will hold all the coin reserves of the public. By law, private banks couldn\u2019t keep their reserves as coins but had to hand them over to the central bank. The central bank in return would give its own banknotes which different private banks will keep as reserves.",
      "This means, over time, the rich get richer (in purchasing power) but the poor get less portion of the purchasing power and hence the wealth gap rises. However, the poor can afford more things and hence poverty reduces over time.",
      "So, fiat-based currency helps the government manage the economy, which is great for the economy and actually helps money move faster and do its job as a medium of exchange. However, because government can interfere at will, it can be counter productive to people who\u2019ve worked hard and accumulated money. Their historically earned money\u2019s purchasing power will go down as government helps the economy by injecting more money.",
      "To drive home this point, consider money as a commodity (like milk) that you can buy. What do you pay to \u201cbuy\u201d money? Your goods and services. What do you get in return when you \u201csell\u201d money? Other people\u2019s goods and services.",
      "Temporary measures that benefit an entity in power soon become permanent, so such temporary abandonment of backing paper money with reserves set the stage for a more permanent abandonment of the gold standard later.",
      "This way, a banknote becomes a substitute for coins. It\u2019s important to understand that banknotes were not money but a money-substitute. Papers were merely a placeholder for the real thing.",
      "65/ Now, if you\u2019ve used the borrowed $100 to pay to someone who holds an account in the same bank, what the bank does is debit your account and credit the other person\u2019s account. So, your database entry will now say $0 and the other person\u2019s account will be increased by $100.\n66/ Note how no currency/cash was involved in the entire transaction and yet for $100 for central bank-issued cash, there\u2019s now $200 worth of money in the economy. This is called money multiplication",
      "Citizens have an incentive to evade taxation, and it\u2019s also an operational nightmare. An easy and convenient alternative to taxation is controlling the money supply in the state. You can call it indirect confiscation.",
      "The biggest benefit of money is in expanding the trade between people, and hence rewarding specialization. Increasing specialization creates prosperity as now you don\u2019t just have shoes, you have sports shoes, party shoes, formal shoes, and so on. So, multiple types of shoes can exist because consumer desire for everything can now be measured in money.",
      "Even without gold backing, the reason the US dollar is still the global reserve currency is that they require oil-producing middle east regions to price their oil in dollars (in exchange for \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201cgood relations\u201d?). Since most nations in the world import oil, the demand for dollars (even though it is not gold-backed) persists",
      "Here\u2019s how the coin debasement works: you stamp coins with your brand, you outlaw all other coins, you require taxes to be paid in stamped coins and when you get coins, you literally melt them and make more coins, each with less weight than before. You keep some of the newly invented coins for yourself and release the remaining.",
      "This inter-bank redemption for coins places a natural limit to how much \u201cphantom\u201d bank notes can circulate in the system. If banks could form a cartel and not redeem each others\u2019 bank notes, they all can keep on growing their profits together.",
      "This warehousing of coins at one central place opens up the possibility of another debasement type of scam. Banks over time realize that because everybody doesn\u2019t redeem their money at once, they can print and issue more banknotes than the coin reserves they have in their warehouse.",
      "Today, the demand and supply for different fiat currencies is either freely determined in the market (freely-floating exchange rates) or is determined by the country (like in China where its central bank determines the Yuan-USD exchange rate).",
      "Similar dynamics happen with money. Only by increasing the amount of money, no prosperity happens. Prosperity happens via innovation \u2013 when there are more (in number and type) goods and services available for people to enjoy.",
      "Kings and rulers of the past depended on direct confiscation of commodities as a way to sustain their armies and lifestyle. This is how taxation came along.",
      "For example, if a widget costs 3 yuans to make, under free-market conditions, you can only buy one widget for one dollar from china. But because of the Chinese central bank\u2019s artificial undervaluing of yuan, you can now buy 2 widgets. Hence Chinese exports surge.",
      "Rather, the prudent thing is to hold assets that lay a claim on some portion of the economy. The best example of such a claim-on-economy is stocks and within stocks, index funds have the best tradeoff for the amount of time you\u2019re willing to invest in researching and returns you\u2019re able to generate.",
      "So the physics-based limits on how light coins can get keeps infinite debasement in check. And because debasement is in check, new money can\u2019t be created indefinitely, so inflation is in check. But that game is about to get changed when governments and kings discover paper money.",
      "To solve this problem, people gradually start accepting a commodity that is divisible into smaller units and which they believe are widely demanded. Take butter for example. You accept it in exchange for the shoes you\u2019ve made because you know you can find someone who wants butter easily and can pay him with a fraction of the butter weight you think is worth what that person is selling.",
      "By manipulating these limits on reserves and via other regulations (such as deciding interbank loan rates), the central bank (which is an arm of the government) directly determines how much money is out there in the economy and hence control the rate of inflation in the economy."

      "Psychologists still debate the exact reasons for this particular effect, but one idea is that the comparison with the decoy offers us an easy justification for an otherwise arbitrary decision. If you were to compare just A and B, it\u2019s hard to know exactly how to appraise the trade-offs between cost and waiting time \u2013 how much money is 90 minutes\u2019 extra wait really worth? ",
      "On a more positive note, scientists in the UK have also started to consider whether the decoy effect might be used to encourage people to make healthier life choices. Christian Von Wagner, a reader in behavioural science and health at University College London, for instance, recently explored people\u2019s intentions to undergo a vital \u2013 but unpleasant \u2013 screening for colorectal cancer. He found that given the choice between arranging an appointment for the screening or not having the procedure at all, many people chose not to go. But if he also presented them with a third option \u2013 an appointment at a less convenient hospital with a longer waiting time, ie, the decoy \u2013 the uptake was greater.",
      " Once again, the presence of the decoy increased people\u2019s intentions to undergo the procedure. \u201cIt was very clear evidence for the presence of the decoy effect,\u201d Von Wagner says \u2013 and proved to be more effective than other strategies, such as trying to appeal to people\u2019s conformity by emphasising the number of other people who were also taking the test."

      "The terms \u2018ennui\u2019 and \u2018boredom\u2019 are often used interchangeably. However, various distinctions have been drawn between these two terms, and in general, the main difference between boredom and ennui is that \u2018boredom\u2019 refers to a mental state that is short-tern and driven primarily by situational and environmental factors, while \u2018ennui\u2019 refers to a mental state that is chronic and driven primarily by dispositional (personality-based) factors.",
      "From a practical perspective, this distinction isn\u2019t crucial. Rather, you can simply view ennui as a chronic type of boredom, that is often characterized by behaviors that aren\u2019t necessarily associated with regular boredom, such as a sense of emptiness.",
      "In the state of ennui the world is emptied of its significance. Everything is seen as if filtered through a screen; what is filtered out and lost is precisely the element that gives meaning to existence. Music is no longer an aesthetic world of sound, but a series of notes. Instead of a painting, one sees only a conglomeration of meaningless colors on a canvas; a book becomes a series of words, one strung after the other. ",
      "Ennui (pronounced on-wee) is a type of chronic boredom, which generally involves weariness, dissatisfaction, and apathy, as well as the tendency to feel that everything is uninteresting and unfulfilling.",
      "Nevertheless, understanding the concept of ennui can be beneficial, because it represents a different mental state than depression, as shown above. Accordingly, some people will feel that the concept of ennui better captures how they feel, which in turn can help them better understand and resolve this issue.",
      "Furthermore, a notable problem with ennui is that some of the behaviors or states of mind that ennui leads to, such as inaction, fatigue, and isolation, are the very things that can cause a person to experience ennui more strongly.\n\n",
      "For example, one study on the topic discusses two additional types of boredom: apathetic boredom, where the bored individual is unconcerned with their environment, and agitated boredom, where the bored individual attempts to engage in meaningful activities, although their attempts to do so fail to satisfy them.",
      " As such, when deciding how to handle your ennui, you should try to figure out what causes you to experience it in the first place, in order to find the best technique for you to use.",
      "Though ennui and depression share many symptoms and can co-occur, these are two separate phenomena.\n\n"

Most bundle splitting techniques require you to load that \u2018index bundle\u2019, and then only once that JavaScript is loaded and executed does your browser know which \u2018page bundle\u2019 it needs. So you need two round-trips to start rendering."

      "Meaning is like the water of our psychological health. Without it, our hearts and minds will shrivel and die. ",
      "Meaning is the association that we draw between two experiences or events in our minds.",

      "There has to be a deeper reason for your goals. Otherwise, the goals themselves will be empty and worthless in the long-run.",
      "When there is great meaning attached to something, like our child is sick and starving, we will go to insane lengths to make things right.",
      "Meaning is that effective at moving people.",
      "But here\u2019s the kicker (and I swear I\u2019m going to get to the ham sandwich): meaning is a resource that we must cultivate in our lives",
      "In a very real sense, the meaning of life is therefore to create meaning."

Everything was now drawn on screen as a picture, including pictures of text. So, assistive technologies on those platforms had to find a new way to obtain information from the interface.",

This created a delay between the introduction of new features and assistive technology\u2019s ability to support it.",
      "To inform a user about an object, an assistive technology would try to determine what the object is by looking for identifying information. For example, in a Windows application, the screen reader might present the Window Class name of an object. ",

      "The API CPU and memory usage is low across the board - thanks to our load balancer adding 10 API instances to the environment - but we\u2019re starting to get a lot of timeouts on requests\u2026why is everything taking so long?\n\nAfter some digging we see it: the Database CPU is hovering at 80-90%. We\u2019re maxed out.",
      "Nearly all highly scaled applications take ample advantage of caching, it\u2019s an absolutely integral part of making a fast API. Better queries and more performant code are all a part of the equation, but without a cache none of these will be sufficient to scale to millions of users.",
      "Scaling the data layer is probably the trickiest part of the equation. While for API servers serving stateless requests, we can merely add more instances, the same is not true with most database systems. In this case, we\u2019re going to explore the popular relational database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)."

      "Now that the browser knows the structure of the document, the style of each element, the geometry of the page, and the paint order, how does it draw a page? Turning this information into pixels on the screen is called rasterizing.",
      "You can divide JavaScript operation into small chunks and schedule to run at every frame using requestAnimationFrame(). ",
      "Similarly, if a pseudo class with content like p::before{content:\"Hi!\"} is applied, it is included in the layout tree even though that is not in the DOM.",
      "\"There is a big red circle and a small blue square\" is not enough information for your friend to know what exactly the painting would look like.\n\n",
      "Even if you do not provide any CSS, each DOM node has a computed style. <h1> tag is displayed bigger than <h2> tag and margins are defined for each element. This is because the browser has a default style sheet.",
      "Sometimes parts of your JavaScript is handled by worker threads if you use a web worker or a service worker. Compositor and raster threads are also run inside of a renderer processes to render a page efficiently and smoothly.",
      "The benefit of compositing is that it is done without involving the main thread. Compositor thread does not need to wait on style calculation or JavaScript execution. This is why compositing only animations are considered the best for smooth performance. If layout or paint needs to be calculated again then the main thread has to be involved.",
      "If scroll happens, since layers are already rasterized, all it has to do is to composite a new frame.",
      "Even if your rendering operations are keeping up with screen refresh, these calculations are running on the main thread, which means it could be blocked when your application is running JavaScript.",
      "When the HTML parser finds a <script> tag, it pauses the parsing of the HTML document and has to load, parse, and execute the JavaScript code. Why? because JavaScript can change the shape of the document using things like document.write() which changes the entire DOM structure ",
      "The compositor thread can prioritize different raster threads so that things within the viewport (or nearby) can be rastered first",
      " If there are things like <img> or <link> in the HTML document, preload scanner peeks at tokens generated by HTML parser and sends requests to the network thread in the browser process.",
      "The main thread parses CSS and determines the computed style for each DOM node.",
      "Perhaps a naive way to handle this would be to raster parts inside of the viewport. If a user scrolls the page, then move the rastered frame, and fill in the missing parts by rastering more. This is how Chrome handled rasterizing when it was first released. However, the modern browser runs a more sophisticated process called compositing.",
      " You know the size, shape, and location of elements, but you still have to judge in what order you paint them.",
      "A layer also has multiple tilings for different resolutions to handle things like zoom-in action.",
      "If certain parts of a page that should be separate layer (like slide-in side menu) is not getting one, then you can hint to the browser by using will-change attribute in CSS.",

      "Once the layer tree is created and paint orders are determined, the main thread commits that information to the compositor thread. The compositor thread then rasterizes each layer. A layer could be large like the entire length of a page, so the compositor thread divides them into tiles and sends each tile off to raster threads. Raster threads rasterize each tile and store them in GPU memory.",
      "There are many ways web developers can send hints to the browser in order to load resources nicely. If your JavaScript does not use document.write(), you can add async or defer attribute to the <script> tag. The browser then loads and runs the JavaScript code asynchronously and does not block the parsing. You may also use JavaScript module if that's suitable. <link rel=\"preload\"> is a way to inform browser that the resource is definitely needed for current navigation and you would like to download as soon as possible. You can read more on this at Resource Prioritization \u2013 Getting the Browser to Help You.",
      "If you are animating elements, the browser has to run these operations in between every frame. ",
      "The layout is a process to find the geometry of elements. The main thread walks through the DOM and computed styles and creates the layout tree which has information like x y coordinates and bounding box sizes. Layout tree may be similar structure to the DOM tree, but it only contains information related to what's visible on the page. If display: none is applied, that element is not part of the layout tree (however, an element with visibility: hidden is in the layout tree). ",
      "At this paint step, the main thread walks the layout tree to create paint records. Paint record is a note of painting process like \"background first, then text, then rectangle\".",
      "You might be tempted to give layers to every element, but compositing across an excess number of layers could result in slower operation than rasterizing small parts of a page every frame, so it is crucial that you measure rendering performance of your application. For more about on topic, see Stick to Compositor-Only Properties and Manage Layer Count.",
      "Determining the Layout of a page is a challenging task. Even the simplest page layout like a block flow from top to bottom has to consider how big the font is and where to line break them because those affect the size and shape of a paragraph; which then affects where the following paragraph needs to be."

      "Another benefit of separating the browser's work into multiple processes is security and \nsandboxing. Since operating systems provide a way to restrict processes\u2019 privileges, the browser \ncan sandbox certain processes from certain features.
