      "The second reason is that some components are critical because they perform critical functions. For instance, no matter how much you sandbox OpenSSL, you still have to worry about the fact that it\u2019s handling your sensitive data, and so if compromised it might leak that. Fortunately, this class of critical components is smaller, but it\u2019s non-zero.",
      "When looked at from this perspective, it\u2019s clear that we have a technology problem: There\u2019s no good reason for individual components to have this much power. Rather, they should only have the capabilities they need to do the job they are intended to to (the technical term is least privilege); it\u2019s just that the software tools we have don\u2019t do a good job of providing this property. This is a situation which has long been recognized in complicated pieces of software like Web browsers, which employ a technique called \u201cprocess sandboxing\u201d (pioneered by Chrome) in which the code that interacts with the Web site is run in its own \u201csandbox\u201d and has limited abilities to interact with your computer. When it wants to do something that it\u2019s not allowed to do, it talks to the main Web browser code and asks it to do it for it, thus allowing that code to enforce the rules without being exposed to vulnerabilities in the rest of the browser.",
      " First, the APIs that we have to work with aren\u2019t sufficiently fine-grained. Consider the case of a component which is designed to let you open and process files on the disk; this necessarily needs to be able to open files, but what stops it from reading your Bitcoins instead of the files that the programmer wanted it to read? It might be possible to create a capability list that includes just reading certain files, but that\u2019s not the API the operating system gives you, so now we need to invent something. There are a lot of cases like this, so things get complicated.",
      "Something we have been looking at internally at Mozilla is a way for those projects to tag the dependencies they use and depend on. The way that this would work is that each project would then be tagged with a set of other projects which used it (e.g., \u201cFirefox uses this crate\u201d). Then when you are considering using a component you could look to see who else uses it, which gives you some measure of confidence. Of course, you don\u2019t know what sort of auditing those organizations do, but if you know that Project X is very security conscious and they use component Y, that should give you some level of confidence. This is really just a automating something that already happens informally: people judge components by who else uses them. ",
      "What\u2019s the standard for not being anonymous? That you have an e-mail address? A Web page? A DUNS number?[3] None of these seem particularly difficult for a dedicated attacker to fake and of course the more strict you make the requirements the more it\u2019s a burden for the (vast majority) of legitimate developers.",
      "More recently, we have been experimenting with a technology called called RLBox developed by researchers at UCSD, UT Austin, and Stanford which allows regular programs such as Firefox to run sandboxed components. The basic idea behind both of these is the same: use static compilation techniques to ensure that the component is memory-safe (i.e., cannot reach outside of itself to touch other parts of the program) and then give it only the capabilities it needs to do its job."

      "Money is simply a commodity with the widest price discovery against all other commodities and because of that everyone accepts it. That is what gives money its purchasing power.",
      "Nobody decides how many grams of gold is a cow worth. The market gradually determines this exchange rate by accounting for supply and demand for both commodities: gold and cows.",
      "Little did the public know that by doing this they\u2019re setting themselves for the erosion of their purchasing power. Originally one dollar was one ounce (~31 grams) of silver. Today, that value has eroded over 96% and for one dollar you\u2019ll only get 0.04 ounces of silver.",
      "The key to understanding money is to remember that it is a commodity whose utility is in facilitating exchanges, just like leather is a commodity whose utility is in making shoe soles.",
      "Such coin debasement is a subtle way of stealing (or redistribution, depending on how you look at things). In other words, debasement leads to inflation. You have more coins in circulation for a similar amount of \u201cstuff\u201d in the world so the prices of \u201cstuff\u201d rise.",
      "Network effects mean that the more widely a currency is accepted by others, the more likely is it to get accepted by others. (This is also why bitcoin is the mother of all network effects).",
      "Here\u2019s the pitch of the govt to its citizens: a central bank will be established that will hold all the coin reserves of the public. By law, private banks couldn\u2019t keep their reserves as coins but had to hand them over to the central bank. The central bank in return would give its own banknotes which different private banks will keep as reserves.",
      "This means, over time, the rich get richer (in purchasing power) but the poor get less portion of the purchasing power and hence the wealth gap rises. However, the poor can afford more things and hence poverty reduces over time.",
      "So, fiat-based currency helps the government manage the economy, which is great for the economy and actually helps money move faster and do its job as a medium of exchange. However, because government can interfere at will, it can be counter productive to people who\u2019ve worked hard and accumulated money. Their historically earned money\u2019s purchasing power will go down as government helps the economy by injecting more money.",
      "To drive home this point, consider money as a commodity (like milk) that you can buy. What do you pay to \u201cbuy\u201d money? Your goods and services. What do you get in return when you \u201csell\u201d money? Other people\u2019s goods and services.",
      "Temporary measures that benefit an entity in power soon become permanent, so such temporary abandonment of backing paper money with reserves set the stage for a more permanent abandonment of the gold standard later.",
      "This way, a banknote becomes a substitute for coins. It\u2019s important to understand that banknotes were not money but a money-substitute. Papers were merely a placeholder for the real thing.",
      "65/ Now, if you\u2019ve used the borrowed $100 to pay to someone who holds an account in the same bank, what the bank does is debit your account and credit the other person\u2019s account. So, your database entry will now say $0 and the other person\u2019s account will be increased by $100.\n66/ Note how no currency/cash was involved in the entire transaction and yet for $100 for central bank-issued cash, there\u2019s now $200 worth of money in the economy. This is called money multiplication",
      "Citizens have an incentive to evade taxation, and it\u2019s also an operational nightmare. An easy and convenient alternative to taxation is controlling the money supply in the state. You can call it indirect confiscation.",
      "The biggest benefit of money is in expanding the trade between people, and hence rewarding specialization. Increasing specialization creates prosperity as now you don\u2019t just have shoes, you have sports shoes, party shoes, formal shoes, and so on. So, multiple types of shoes can exist because consumer desire for everything can now be measured in money.",
      "Even without gold backing, the reason the US dollar is still the global reserve currency is that they require oil-producing middle east regions to price their oil in dollars (in exchange for \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201cgood relations\u201d?). Since most nations in the world import oil, the demand for dollars (even though it is not gold-backed) persists",
      "Here\u2019s how the coin debasement works: you stamp coins with your brand, you outlaw all other coins, you require taxes to be paid in stamped coins and when you get coins, you literally melt them and make more coins, each with less weight than before. You keep some of the newly invented coins for yourself and release the remaining.",
      "This inter-bank redemption for coins places a natural limit to how much \u201cphantom\u201d bank notes can circulate in the system. If banks could form a cartel and not redeem each others\u2019 bank notes, they all can keep on growing their profits together.",
      "This warehousing of coins at one central place opens up the possibility of another debasement type of scam. Banks over time realize that because everybody doesn\u2019t redeem their money at once, they can print and issue more banknotes than the coin reserves they have in their warehouse.",
      "Today, the demand and supply for different fiat currencies is either freely determined in the market (freely-floating exchange rates) or is determined by the country (like in China where its central bank determines the Yuan-USD exchange rate).",
      "Similar dynamics happen with money. Only by increasing the amount of money, no prosperity happens. Prosperity happens via innovation \u2013 when there are more (in number and type) goods and services available for people to enjoy.",
      "Kings and rulers of the past depended on direct confiscation of commodities as a way to sustain their armies and lifestyle. This is how taxation came along.",
      "For example, if a widget costs 3 yuans to make, under free-market conditions, you can only buy one widget for one dollar from china. But because of the Chinese central bank\u2019s artificial undervaluing of yuan, you can now buy 2 widgets. Hence Chinese exports surge.",
      "Rather, the prudent thing is to hold assets that lay a claim on some portion of the economy. The best example of such a claim-on-economy is stocks and within stocks, index funds have the best tradeoff for the amount of time you\u2019re willing to invest in researching and returns you\u2019re able to generate.",
      "So the physics-based limits on how light coins can get keeps infinite debasement in check. And because debasement is in check, new money can\u2019t be created indefinitely, so inflation is in check. But that game is about to get changed when governments and kings discover paper money.",
      "To solve this problem, people gradually start accepting a commodity that is divisible into smaller units and which they believe are widely demanded. Take butter for example. You accept it in exchange for the shoes you\u2019ve made because you know you can find someone who wants butter easily and can pay him with a fraction of the butter weight you think is worth what that person is selling.",
      "By manipulating these limits on reserves and via other regulations (such as deciding interbank loan rates), the central bank (which is an arm of the government) directly determines how much money is out there in the economy and hence control the rate of inflation in the economy."

If more employees can work from anywhere and save money by not commuting and eating at home every day, they\u2019ll be able to travel more frequently. A higher proportion of travel will be for pleasure instead of business, meaning that consumer-focused companies like Airbnb look more attractive than hotels, which generate a lot of revenue from business travel and corporate events.",

A laptop was a poor substitute for the real thing.",

Partially, it\u2019s because the new thing is clunky; of course it is, it\u2019s new. And partially, it\u2019s because all of the other things that will spring up around the new thing haven\u2019t sprung up yet.",
      "In other words, the decision isn\u2019t up to the traditional decision-makers. The possibility of Remote work will create a liquid global talent marketplace, unshackling employment and geography and giving the best employees more optionality than they\u2019ve ever had. Forward-thinking companies, too, will have more qualified candidates to choose from than ever before.",
      "Because of the biggest exogenous shock to the system in decades, remote work, which can be viewed comprehensively as a technology, hasn\u2019t gotten the chance to methodically work its way through the Adoption S-Curve. Instead, like Snapchat, Laptops, and Bitcoin, it\u2019s going through one of my favorite frameworks: the Gartner Hype Cycle",
      "This is where things start getting really wild. Unshackled by the office\u2019s location, people will move where they want to move, often out of expensive cities and into more affordable towns with better weather. Those are first-and second-order effects. Some third-order effect might be that because they\u2019re saving more money, they have more money to invest, and the trends that I wrote about in Software is Eating the Markets towards more retail investment in stocks, art, real estate, and more will accelerate.",
      "If you choose to Return, you\u2019re essentially making a bet that the benefits of all being in the same office every day outweighs the risks of attracting lesser talent and potentially losing your best employees. Mayyyyybe you make that trade if you assume that physical and digital solutions will remain exactly as they are today. But they won\u2019t. They\u2019re already improving.",
      "Remote\u2019s ecosystem is underdeveloped. We\u2019ve had to shoehorn pre-Remote solutions to fit a new paradigm, and the impending wave of new tools hasn\u2019t yet arrived."

      "Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.",
      "As a founder, nobody is going to understand the full nuance of your company like you will. Everyone else does see a simplified, compressed, and sadly imperfect shadow of your company. Founders repeatedly underestimate the degree to which their products are complex and opaque to outsiders, because they have it fully loaded in cache. They have seen every iteration and revision and imagined in painful detail all the alternate lives their product could have lived.",
      "Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don\u2019t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.",
      " Like memes, simplicity is what makes them so transmissible.",
      "Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit.",
      "There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases.",
      "Often the smell test of a company is how easily it can be dimensionally reduced.",
      "The internet drove entirely new design use cases.",
      "Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.",
      "Market entropy is good for new entrants.",
      "The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it\u2019s unusable, but not too low that it\u2019s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.",
      "The best companies introduce better atomic concepts and help push their customers forward. Strong enough products will have ecosystems around them whether or not the companies actively manage it. The best companies don\u2019t just benefit from these ecosystems, they build their platforms to enable and direct these ecosystems in ways that empower their customers more.",
      " It\u2019s essential for founders and companies themselves to regularly do this refactoring. Just as companies build up technical debt, so too do they build up narrative debt.",
      "They choose the right atomic concepts.\n\nThese are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that\u2026well for lack of a better word\u2026compound.",
      "This is just one example of how companies can use platform network effects to extend and defend their beachhead. There are few sources of defensibility stronger than the cross-side network effects of platforms. It makes it hard for any new competitors to get traction. Without a large enough user base, a new platform can\u2019t attract developers to build on top of it. As a result, new competitors also lack the ecosystem of add-ons to meet all the needs of and attract users. This is why platforms are so enduring. They allow companies to scale the needs they meet beyond what\u2019s possible for a single company and they create chicken and egg problems for any competitor hoping to follow."

This sets off an elaborate tango that involves multiple stakeholders. The moment you swipe your card, the store owner\u2019s bank will receive the transaction information associated with your purchase. The bank will now have to verify with SBI if you\u2019ve got enough money to pay for the purchase. And they\u2019ll also have to see if all your information checks out.\n\nHowever, they can\u2019t do it on their own. Instead, they\u2019ll have to rely on a payment network operated by Visa, Mastercard or RuPay. Once these guys enter the fray, they\u2019ll relay the information to SBI and after everything checks out, the money will finally be credited to the store owner\u2019s account. That is after everyone has taken their cut. Your bank will take a small piece of the pie. The merchant\u2019s bank will take its cut and the likes of Visa and Mastercard will take their share. And the store owner will only receive what\u2019s left. In essence, if the MDR stood at 1%, he will receive \u20b999 from your purchase."

      "Psychologists still debate the exact reasons for this particular effect, but one idea is that the comparison with the decoy offers us an easy justification for an otherwise arbitrary decision. If you were to compare just A and B, it\u2019s hard to know exactly how to appraise the trade-offs between cost and waiting time \u2013 how much money is 90 minutes\u2019 extra wait really worth? ",
      "On a more positive note, scientists in the UK have also started to consider whether the decoy effect might be used to encourage people to make healthier life choices. Christian Von Wagner, a reader in behavioural science and health at University College London, for instance, recently explored people\u2019s intentions to undergo a vital \u2013 but unpleasant \u2013 screening for colorectal cancer. He found that given the choice between arranging an appointment for the screening or not having the procedure at all, many people chose not to go. But if he also presented them with a third option \u2013 an appointment at a less convenient hospital with a longer waiting time, ie, the decoy \u2013 the uptake was greater.",
      " Once again, the presence of the decoy increased people\u2019s intentions to undergo the procedure. \u201cIt was very clear evidence for the presence of the decoy effect,\u201d Von Wagner says \u2013 and proved to be more effective than other strategies, such as trying to appeal to people\u2019s conformity by emphasising the number of other people who were also taking the test."

      "From a practical perspective, this distinction isn\u2019t crucial. Rather, you can simply view ennui as a chronic type of boredom, that is often characterized by behaviors that aren\u2019t necessarily associated with regular boredom, such as a sense of emptiness.",
      "In the state of ennui the world is emptied of its significance. Everything is seen as if filtered through a screen; what is filtered out and lost is precisely the element that gives meaning to existence. Music is no longer an aesthetic world of sound, but a series of notes. Instead of a painting, one sees only a conglomeration of meaningless colors on a canvas; a book becomes a series of words, one strung after the other. ",
      "Ennui (pronounced on-wee) is a type of chronic boredom, which generally involves weariness, dissatisfaction, and apathy, as well as the tendency to feel that everything is uninteresting and unfulfilling.",
      "Nevertheless, understanding the concept of ennui can be beneficial, because it represents a different mental state than depression, as shown above. Accordingly, some people will feel that the concept of ennui better captures how they feel, which in turn can help them better understand and resolve this issue.",
      "Furthermore, a notable problem with ennui is that some of the behaviors or states of mind that ennui leads to, such as inaction, fatigue, and isolation, are the very things that can cause a person to experience ennui more strongly.\n\n",
      "For example, one study on the topic discusses two additional types of boredom: apathetic boredom, where the bored individual is unconcerned with their environment, and agitated boredom, where the bored individual attempts to engage in meaningful activities, although their attempts to do so fail to satisfy them.",
      " As such, when deciding how to handle your ennui, you should try to figure out what causes you to experience it in the first place, in order to find the best technique for you to use.",
      "Though ennui and depression share many symptoms and can co-occur, these are two separate phenomena.\n\n"

      "Fantasies are like any other Distraction \u2013 they are to be used sparingly and for nothing other than pure enjoyment. It\u2019s when they begin to sustain your sense of self-worth, your desire for importance in this world, that you will be hobbling yourself, and you will never Level Up again in Life"

      "As the app continues to scale, we\u2019re going to want to focus on splitting out services that can be scaled independently. For example, if we start to make use of websockets, it would make sense to pull out our websocket handling code",
      "A load balancer also enables autoscaling. ",
      "We\u2019re also going to continue to bump up against limitations on the data layer. This is when we are going to want to start looking into partitioning and sharding the database.",
      "This is why I like to think of the client as separate from the API. It makes it very easy to reason about building for multiple platforms: web, mobile web, iOS, Android, desktop apps, third party services etc. They\u2019re all just clients consuming the same API",
      "We should be using a cloud storage service to host static content at this point: think images, videos, and more (AWS\u2019s S3 or Digital Ocean\u2019s Spaces). In general, our API should avoid handling things like serving images and image uploads.",

      "Load balancers are very powerful. The key idea is that we place a load balancer in front of the API and it will route traffic to an instance of that service. This allows for horizontal scaling (increasing the amount of requests we can handle by adding more servers running the same code).",
      "We will want to make sure that we have monitoring installed using a service like New Relic or Datadog. This will ensure we understand what requests are slow and where improvement needs to be made.",

With the managed services above, this can be done in one-click. A read replica will stay up to date with your master DB, and will be able to be used for SELECT statements.",
      "One of the easiest ways to get more out of our database is by introducing a new component to the system: the cache layer.",
      "The API CPU and memory usage is low across the board - thanks to our load balancer adding 10 API instances to the environment - but we\u2019re starting to get a lot of timeouts on requests\u2026why is everything taking so long?\n\nAfter some digging we see it: the Database CPU is hovering at 80-90%. We\u2019re maxed out.",

      "The most important thing to grasp in rendering pipeline is that at each step the result of the previous operation is used to create new data. For example, if something changes in the layout tree, then the Paint order needs to be regenerated for affected parts of the document.",
      "This is because the HTML specification is designed to handle those errors gracefully. ",
      "Now that the browser knows the structure of the document, the style of each element, the geometry of the page, and the paint order, how does it draw a page? Turning this information into pixels on the screen is called rasterizing.",
      "You can divide JavaScript operation into small chunks and schedule to run at every frame using requestAnimationFrame(). ",
      "Similarly, if a pseudo class with content like p::before{content:\"Hi!\"} is applied, it is included in the layout tree even though that is not in the DOM.",
      "\"There is a big red circle and a small blue square\" is not enough information for your friend to know what exactly the painting would look like.\n\n",
      "Even if you do not provide any CSS, each DOM node has a computed style. <h1> tag is displayed bigger than <h2> tag and margins are defined for each element. This is because the browser has a default style sheet.",
      "Sometimes parts of your JavaScript is handled by worker threads if you use a web worker or a service worker. Compositor and raster threads are also run inside of a renderer processes to render a page efficiently and smoothly.",
      "The benefit of compositing is that it is done without involving the main thread. Compositor thread does not need to wait on style calculation or JavaScript execution. This is why compositing only animations are considered the best for smooth performance. If layout or paint needs to be calculated again then the main thread has to be involved.",
      "If scroll happens, since layers are already rasterized, all it has to do is to composite a new frame.",
      "Even if your rendering operations are keeping up with screen refresh, these calculations are running on the main thread, which means it could be blocked when your application is running JavaScript.",
      "When the HTML parser finds a <script> tag, it pauses the parsing of the HTML document and has to load, parse, and execute the JavaScript code. Why? because JavaScript can change the shape of the document using things like document.write() which changes the entire DOM structure ",
      "The compositor thread can prioritize different raster threads so that things within the viewport (or nearby) can be rastered first",
      " If there are things like <img> or <link> in the HTML document, preload scanner peeks at tokens generated by HTML parser and sends requests to the network thread in the browser process.",
      "The main thread parses CSS and determines the computed style for each DOM node.",
      "Perhaps a naive way to handle this would be to raster parts inside of the viewport. If a user scrolls the page, then move the rastered frame, and fill in the missing parts by rastering more. This is how Chrome handled rasterizing when it was first released. However, the modern browser runs a more sophisticated process called compositing.",
      " You know the size, shape, and location of elements, but you still have to judge in what order you paint them.",
      "A layer also has multiple tilings for different resolutions to handle things like zoom-in action.",
      "If certain parts of a page that should be separate layer (like slide-in side menu) is not getting one, then you can hint to the browser by using will-change attribute in CSS.",
      "When the renderer process receives a commit message for a navigation and starts to receive HTML data, the main thread begins to parse the text string (HTML) and turn it into a Document Object Model (DOM).",

      "Compositing is a technique to separate parts of a page into layers, rasterize them separately, and composite as a page in a separate thread called compositor thread. ",
      "Once the layer tree is created and paint orders are determined, the main thread commits that information to the compositor thread. The compositor thread then rasterizes each layer. A layer could be large like the entire length of a page, so the compositor thread divides them into tiles and sends each tile off to raster threads. Raster threads rasterize each tile and store them in GPU memory.",
      "There are many ways web developers can send hints to the browser in order to load resources nicely. If your JavaScript does not use document.write(), you can add async or defer attribute to the <script> tag. The browser then loads and runs the JavaScript code asynchronously and does not block the parsing. You may also use JavaScript module if that's suitable. <link rel=\"preload\"> is a way to inform browser that the resource is definitely needed for current navigation and you would like to download as soon as possible. You can read more on this at Resource Prioritization \u2013 Getting the Browser to Help You.",
      "If you are animating elements, the browser has to run these operations in between every frame. ",
      "The layout is a process to find the geometry of elements. The main thread walks through the DOM and computed styles and creates the layout tree which has information like x y coordinates and bounding box sizes. Layout tree may be similar structure to the DOM tree, but it only contains information related to what's visible on the page. If display: none is applied, that element is not part of the layout tree (however, an element with visibility: hidden is in the layout tree). ",
      "At this paint step, the main thread walks the layout tree to create paint records. Paint record is a note of painting process like \"background first, then text, then rectangle\".",
      "You might be tempted to give layers to every element, but compositing across an excess number of layers could result in slower operation than rasterizing small parts of a page every frame, so it is crucial that you measure rendering performance of your application. For more about on topic, see Stick to Compositor-Only Properties and Manage Layer Count.",
      "Determining the Layout of a page is a challenging task. Even the simplest page layout like a block flow from top to bottom has to consider how big the font is and where to line break them because those affect the size and shape of a paragraph; which then affects where the following paragraph needs to be."

      "Too often, people feel too proud to ask for support. I\u2019ll tell you this: No one on earth is strong enough to go through all adversity alone. Sure, you might be strong enough to deal with the challenges of life. But there always comes a time when things become \u201ctoo much.\u201d\n    \n\n    \n        That\u2019s when you need help. When that time comes: Ask.",
      "We need to boost your dopamine. To do that, we need to reward ourselves (again, don\u2019t buy anything). Do something that makes you enjoy life. That\u2019s my standard.",
      "Sitting at home and feeling sorry for yourself is not going to help. ",
      "But in recent years, I\u2019ve learned to adopt an active mindset. When I lose motivation, I either come up with a list of things I want to do or set some new goals for myself. And then, I start working on it.",
      "When you create a plan, you\u2019re by definition looking at the future. And when we imagine a better future, we start feeling better.",
      "Well, what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen? Will those things kill you? Probably not.\n    \n\n    \n        This exercise makes us aware of how irrational and fearful we are. Simply ask the question and spend some time meditating on it."

      "Well, it could be one process with many \ndifferent threads or many different processes with a few threads communicating over IPC.",
      "Chrome is undergoing architecture changes to \nrun each part of the browser program as a service allowing to easily split into different processes \nor aggregate into one",
      "A process can ask the Operating System to spin up another process to run different tasks.",
      "For the renderer process, multiple processes are created and assigned to \neach tab. ",
      "The following table describes each Chrome process and what it controls:",
      "A process can be described as an application\u2019s executing program. A thread is the one that lives \ninside of process and executes any part of its process's program.",
      "Until very recently, Chrome gave each tab a process when it could; now it tries to give \neach site its own process, including iframes (see Site Isolation).",
      "If one tab becomes unresponsive, then you can close the unresponsive tab and move on while keeping \nother tabs alive. If all tabs are running on one process, when one tab becomes unresponsive, all \nthe tabs are unresponsive. That\u2019s sad.",
      "it was first developed to handle graphics.",
      "Also handles the invisible, privileged parts of a web browser such as \n      network requests and file access.",
      "It is separated into different process \n      because GPUs handles requests from multiple apps and draw them in the same surface.",
      "Because processes have their own private memory space, they often contain copies of common \ninfrastructure (like V8 which is a Chrome's JavaScript engine). ",
      "A core is like another CPU living in \nthe same chip. In modern hardware, you often get more than one core, giving more computing power \nto your phones and laptops.",
      "can handle many different tasks \none by one as they come in. It can handle everything from math to art while knowing how to reply \nto a customer call.",
      "The Operating System gives the process a \"slab\" of memory to work \nwith and all application state is kept in that private memory space. When you close the \napplication, the process also goes away and the Operating System frees up the memory.",
      "In recent years, with GPU-accelerated computing, more and more computation is becoming possible on \nGPU alone.",
      "Usually, applications run on the CPU and GPU using mechanisms provided by the \nOperating System.",
      "One browser\u2019s approach may \nbe completely different from another.",
      "Unlike CPU, \nGPU is good at handling simple tasks but across multiple cores at the same time. ",
      "but when Chrome hits \nthe limit, it starts to run multiple tabs from the same site in one process.",
      "Many applications \nare designed to work this way so that if a worker process get unresponsive, it can be restarted \nwithout stopping other processes which are running different parts of the application.",
      "In order to save memory, Chrome puts a limit on how many processes it can spin up. \nThe limit varies depending on how much memory and CPU power your device",
      "Another benefit of separating the browser's work into multiple processes is security and \nsandboxing. Since operating systems provide a way to restrict processes\u2019 privileges, the browser \ncan sandbox certain processes from certain features. For example, the Chrome browser restricts \narbitrary file access for processes that handle arbitrary user input like the renderer process.",
      "The important thing to note here is that these different architectures are implementation details.",
      "At the top is the browser process coordinating with other processes that take care of different \nparts of the application"

      "But how to cultivate that sense of detachment from a poisonous, unhelpful or just plain wrong stream of thinking? Visual clues can help: a post-it on a computer screen (mine just says \u201cthinking \u2026\u201d) or a screensaver on a phone. I wear a black wristband to remind me why I do this. A discreet tattoo might do the same, if that\u2019s your thing.",
      " But each time you are submerged, eventually you notice and pull yourself out and sit undisturbed, again and again until it starts to become habit to notice the thought rather than believe it.",
      "And second, whether right or wrong, these self-evaluations simply are not helpful. They just make us feel worse.",
      "We need a completely new relationship with our thoughts. Instead of viewing the world and our experience as we think they ought to be, we need to treat them as they actually are. ",
      "You\u2019re not who you think you are. You\u2019re so much more than that.",
      " First, it is probably incorrect. ",
      "we need to direct our attentions to things we can influence, and leave the rest be."
